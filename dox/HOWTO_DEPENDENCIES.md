# Dependencies

MulleObjCFoundation depends on

* [MulleObjC](//github.com/mulle-nat/MulleObjC)
* [mulle_allocator](//github.com/mulle-nat/mulle-allocator)
* [mulle_buffer](//github.com/mulle-nat/mulle-buffer)
* [mulle_container](//github.com/mulle-nat/mulle-container)
* [mulle_sprintf](//github.com/mulle-nat/mulle-sprintf)
* [mulle_utf](//github.com/mulle-nat/mulle-utf)
* standard C libraries (but for example no `<unistd.h>`)

MulleObjCFoundation should not depend on ICU, `<unistd.h>` or any POSIX headers.
MulleObjC should not use `mulle_objc_runtime` functions directly, but only
through `MulleObjC`.


# TODO

* KVC doesn't cache yet


## MulleObjCFoundation should not directly depend on `mulle_objc_runtime` but only on MulleObjC

* KVC breaks this in a big way, unsaveable
* _MulleObjCCheatingASCIIStringStorage storage does too
* MulleObjCArchiver/MulleObjCUnrchiver could be corrected I guess
* MulleObjCArchiver can be saved I guess
* interface with MulleObjC runtime via "ns_foundationconfiguration"
* otherwise it is `mulle_objc_runtime` agnostic, which means no `mulle_objc` 
function calls or structure access.

## MulleObjCFoundation should not define MulleObjC symbols but _NS instead

* this is broken all over and keeps breaking. Think this through again.


## Why are there so many little internal libraries ?

The sub-libraries are there to structure the project. The "Core" libraries
Container, Data, Exception, String, Value are interdependent. 

Whereas Locale, KVC, Archiver can be taken out and stuff should still compile.
Possibly they will even move to different libraries in the future.
